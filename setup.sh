# @file setup.sh
# @description This script automates the setup of a development environment on macOS.
# It handles the installation of Homebrew, essential command-line tools, and
# GUI applications, and configures Zsh as the default shell. The script is
# designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without
# causing issues.
#
# @section Usage
# To run the script, execute it from your terminal:
#   ./setup.sh
#
# You will be prompted to select your Mac's architecture (Apple Silicon or Intel).
# The script may also ask for your password for 'sudo' commands (e.g., to change
# the default shell).
##

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
# Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
set -u
